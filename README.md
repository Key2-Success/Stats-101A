# Stats 101A
Stats 101A is Introduction to Data Analysis and Regression, who I took under Professor Gould in Fall of 2016. I have included my 9 homework assignments and final report. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in R. My final grade in the class was an A-, however I did not score perfectly on all of the assignments. My grades for the homework assignments and final report are as follows:
